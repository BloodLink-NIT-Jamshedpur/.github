# **SERVICE**:
## 1.**POTENTIAL BLOOD DONORS**:
Our system, powered by Machine Learning, proactively identifies potential donors when specific blood group levels fall below a critical mark at blood bank. Automated reminders ensure targeted outreach, encouraging regular blood donations and eliminating shortages. This cycle of donation will eradicate shortage of blood.

Locate the nearest blood bank swiftly using Google Maps. Receive real-time updates on critical blood group shortages, facilitating efficient responses during emergencies and voluntary donations.

## 3.Unified Registration of Blood Donors and Blood Banks using Firebase:
